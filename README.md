# Luangwa Rift Fault Scarp Measurements

Scarp height measurements for faults in the Luangwa Rift performed by Tess Turner for her University of Bristol MSci Earth Sciences final year project.

These measurements were performed on SRTM data using the method outlined in [Wedmore et al., 2020].

## Data Format

Files are provided in comma separated value ([csv]) format. Each file contains one header line with descriptions of the data contained within each column. The column headings and extra information are summarised in the table below.
